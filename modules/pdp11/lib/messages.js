 * Message categories supported by the messageEnabled() function and other assorted message
 * functions. Each category has a corresponding bit value that can be combined (ie, OR'ed) as
 * needed.  The Debugger's message command ("m") is used to turn message categories on and off,
 * like so:
 *
 *      m port on
 *      m port off
 *      ...
 *
 * NOTE: The order of these categories can be rearranged, alphabetized, etc, as desired; just be
 * aware that changing the bit values could break saved Debugger states (not a huge concern, just
 * something to be aware of).
