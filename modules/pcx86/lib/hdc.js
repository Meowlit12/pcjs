     * HDC(parmsHDC)
     *
     * The HDC component simulates an STC-506/412 interface to an IBM-compatible fixed disk drive. The first
     * such drive was a 10Mb 5.25-inch drive containing two platters and 4 heads. Data spanned 306 cylinders
     * for a total of 1224 tracks, with 17 sectors/track and 512 bytes/sector.  Support has since been expanded
     * to include the original PC AT Western Digital controller.
     *
     * HDC supports the following component-specific properties:
     *
     *      drives: an array of driveConfig objects, each containing 'name', 'path', 'size' and 'type' properties
     *      type:   either 'XT' (for the PC XT Xebec controller) or 'AT' (for the PC AT Western Digital controller)
     *
     * The 'type' parameter defaults to 'XT'.  All ports for the PC XT controller are referred to as XTC ports,
     * and similarly, all PC AT controller ports are referred to as ATC ports.
     *
     * If 'path' is empty, a scratch disk image is created; otherwise, we make a note of the path, but we will NOT
     * pre-load it like we do for floppy disk images.
     *
     * My current plan is to read all disk data on-demand, keeping a cache of what we've read, and possibly adding
     * some read-ahead as well. Any portions of the disk image that are written before being read will never be read.
     *
     * TRIVIA: On p.1-179 of the PC XT Technical Reference Manual (revised APR83), it reads:
     *
     *      "WARNING: The last cylinder on the fixed disk drive is reserved for diagnostic use.
     *      Diagnostic write tests will destroy any data on this cylinder."
     *
     * Does FDISK insure that the last cylinder is reserved?  I'm sure we'll eventually find out.

     *
     * NOTE: This function differentiates HDC requests from FDC requests, based on whether the INT 0x13 drive number
     * in DL is >= 0x80.
     *
     * HACK: The HDC BIOS code for both INT 0x13/AH=0x00 and INT 0x13/AH=0x09 calls "INIT_DRV" @C800:0427, which is
     * hard-coded to issue the HDC.XTC.DATA.CMD.INIT_DRIVE command for BOTH drives 0 and 1 (aka drive numbers 0x80 and
     * 0x81), regardless of the drive number specified in DL; this means that the HDC.XTC.DATA.CMD.INIT_DRIVE command
     * must always succeed for drive 1 if it also succeeds for drive 0 -- even if there is no drive 1.  Bizarre, but OK,
     * whatever.
     *
     * So assuming we a have drive 0, when the power-on diagnostics in "DISK_SETUP" @C800:0003 call INT 0x13/AH=0x09
     * (@C800:00DB) for drive 0, it must succeed.  No problem.  But when "DISK_SETUP" starts probing for additional drives,
     * it first issues INT 0x13/AH=0x00, followed by INT 0x13/AH=0x11, and finally INT 0x13/AH=0x09.  If the first
     * (AH=0x00) or third (AH=0x09) INT 0x13 fails, it quickly moves on (ie, it jumps to "POD_DONE").  But as we just
     * discussed, both those operations call "INIT_DRV", which can't return an error.  This means the only function that
     * can return an error in this context is the recalibrate function (AH=0x11).  That sucks, because the way the HDC
     * BIOS is written, it will loop for anywhere from 1.5 seconds to 25 seconds (depending on whether the controller
     * is part of the "System Unit" or not; see port 0x213), attempting to recalibrate drive 1 until it finally times out.
     *
     * Normally, you'll only experience the 1.5 second delay, but even so, it's a ridiculous waste of time and a lot of
     * useless INT 0x13 calls.  So I monitor INT 0x13/AH=0x00 for DL >= 0x80 and set a special HDC.XTC.DATA.CMD.INIT_DRIVE
     * override flag (iDriveAllowFail) that will allow that command to fail, and in theory, make the the HDC BIOS
     * "DISK_SETUP" code much more efficient.

     * intBIOSDiskette(addr)
     *
     * When the HDC BIOS overwrites the ROM BIOS INT 0x13 address, it saves the original INT 0x13 address
     * in the INT 0x40 vector.  This function intercepts calls to that vector to work around a minor nuisance.
     *
     * The HDC BIOS's plan was simple, albeit slightly flawed: assign fixed disks drive numbers >= 0x80,
     * and whenever someone calls INT 0x13 with a drive number < 0x80, invoke the original INT 0x13 diskette
     * code via INT 0x40 and return via RET 2.
     *
     * Unfortunately, not all original INT 0x13 functions required a drive number in DL (eg, the "reset"
     * function, where AH=0).  And the HDC BIOS knew this, which is why, in the case of the "reset" function,
     * the HDC BIOS performs BOTH an INT 0x40 diskette reset AND an HDC reset -- it can't be sure which
     * controller the caller really wants to reset.
     *
     * An unfortunate side-effect of this behavior: when the HDC BIOS is initialized for the first time, it may
     * issue several resets internally, depending on whether there are 0, 1 or 2 hard drives installed, and each
     * of those resets also triggers completely useless diskette resets, each wasting up to two seconds waiting
     * for the FDC to interrupt.  The FDC tries to interrupt, but it can't, because at this early stage of
     * ROM BIOS initialization, IRQ.FDC hasn't been unmasked yet.
     *
     * My work-around: have the HDC component hook INT 0x40, and every time an INT 0x40 is issued with AH=0 and
     * IRQ.FDC masked, bypass the INT 0x40 interrupt.  This is as close as PCx86 has come to patching any BIOS code
     * (something I've refused to do), and even here, I'm not doing it out of necessity, just annoyance.

 * Starting with the IBM PC AT, the ROM defined a "Fixed Disk Parameter Table" (FD_TBL) that contained 16 bytes
 * at the following offsets for each of 47 drive types (see IBM 5170 Tech Ref, March 1986, p. 5-185):
 * 
 *      0: maximum number of cylinders (word)

 *      E: number of sectors/track (NOTE: all PC AT drive types specified 17 sectors/track)
 *      F: reserved
 *      
 * NOTE: While drive type 0 was a valid type in the PC XT, it was NOT a valid drive type in the PC AT; zero was used
 * to indicate that no hard drive was installed.
 * 
 * Of the 47 PC AT drive types, the first 14 (1-E) could be selected by 4 bits in CMOS byte 0x12.  Drive type 15 was not
 * a valid type but rather an indicator that CMOS byte 0x19 (or 0x1A) contained the actual drive type, which technically
 * could contain any value from 0-255, but was documented as being limited to values 16-255.  And in fact, the ROM only
 * contained entries for drive types 1-47, and of those, only drive types 1-14 and 16-23 were valid; the rest (15 and 24-47)
 * were marked "RESERVED" and contained zeros.
 * 
 * If a system needed a drive type that wasn't defined by the ROM, it could be placed in RAM, as the ROM explained:
 * 
 *      To dynamically define a set of parameters, build a table for up to 15 types and place
 *      the corresponding vector into interrupt 0x41 for drive 0 and interrupt 0x46 for drive 1.
 *      
 * To make PCjs easier to configure, we have three drive tables (for XT, AT, and COMPAQ machines), each of which
 * contains DriveArrays for the various DriveTypes supported by each machine.  Each DriveArray contains the following
 * subset of "Fixed Disk Parameter Table" information:
 *
 *      [0]: total cylinders
 *      [1]: total heads
 *      [2]: total sectors/tracks (optional; default is 17)
 *      [3]: total bytes/sector (optional; default is 512)
 *
 * verifyDrive() attempts to confirm that these values agree with the programmed drive characteristics.
 *
 * NOTE: For the record, PCjs considers 1Kb to be 1 kilobyte (1,024 bytes, not 1,000 bytes) and 1Mb to be 1 megabyte
 * (1024*1024 or 1,048,576 bytes, not 1,000,000 bytes).
 *
 * Apparently, in 1998, it was decided that a kilobyte should be 1,000 bytes and a megabyte should be 1,000,000 bytes,
 * and that if you really meant 2^10 (1,024) or 2^20 (1,048,576), you should use "kibibyte" (KiB) or "mebibyte" (MiB)
 * instead.  But since PCjs simulates machines that pre-date 1998, I have chosen to retain the original understanding
 * of Kb and Mb; I never use KiB or MiB.  Besides, I suspect these changes were little more than a self-serving push
 * by hard drive manufacturers who wanted to exaggerate their disk capacities by dividing total drive space by 1,000,000
 * rather than 1,048,576.

/*
 * ATC (AT Controller) Registers
 *
 * The "IBM Personal Computer AT Fixed Disk and Diskette Drive Adapter", aka the HFCOMBO card, contains what we refer
 * to here as the ATC (AT Controller).  Even though that card contains both Fixed Disk and Diskette Drive controllers,
 * this component (HDC) still deals only with the "Fixed Disk" portion.  Fortunately, the "Diskette Drive Adapter"
 * portion of the card is compatible with the existing FDC component, so that component continues to be responsible
 * for all diskette operations.
 *
 * ATC ports default to their primary addresses; secondary port addresses are 0x80 lower (eg, 0x170 instead of 0x1F0).
 *
 * It's important to know that the MODEL_5170 BIOS has a special relationship with the "Combo Hard File/Diskette
 * (HFCOMBO) Card" (see @F000:144C).  Initially, the ChipSet component intercepted reads for HFCOMBO's STATUS port
 * and returned the BUSY bit clear to reduce boot time; however, it turned out that was also a prerequisite for the
 * BIOS to write test patterns to the CYLLO port (0x1F4) and set the "DUAL" bit (bit 0) of the "HFCNTRL" byte at 40:8Fh
 * if those CYLLO operations succeeded (now that the HDC is "ATC-aware", the ChipSet port intercepts have been removed).
 *
 * Without the "DUAL" bit set, when it came time later to report the diskette drive type, the "DISK_TYPE" function
 * (@F000:273D) would branch to one of two almost-identical blocks of code -- specifically, a block that disallowed
 * diskette drive types >= 2 (ChipSet.CMOS.FDRIVE.FD360) instead of >= 3 (ChipSet.CMOS.FDRIVE.FD1200).
 *
 * In other words, the "Fixed Disk" portion of the HFCOMBO controller has to be present and operational if the user
 * wants to use high-capacity (80-track) diskettes with "Diskette Drive" portion of the controller.  This may not be
 * immediately obvious to anyone creating a 5170 machine configuration with the FDC component but no HDC component.
 *
 * TODO: Investigate what a MODEL_5170 can do, if anything, with diskettes if an "HFCOMBO card" was NOT installed;
 * eg, was there Diskette-only Controller that could be installed, and if so, did it support high-capacity diskette
 * drives?  Also, consider making the FDC component able to detect when the HDC is missing and provide the same minimal
 * HFCOMBO port intercepts that ChipSet once provided (this is not a requirement, just a usability improvement).
 *
 * UPDATE: I later discovered that newer (ie, REV2 and REV3) 5170 ROMs are even less happy when no HDC is installed,
 * *unless* an undocumented FDC "DIAGNOSTIC" register (port 0x3F1) provides a "MULTIPLE DATA RATE" response, bypassing
 * the HDC port tests described above.  This may also imply that those newer 5170 revisions are incompatible with FD360
 * diskette drives, because if none of the "MULTIPLE DATA RATE" tests succeed, a "601-Diskette Error" always occurs.
