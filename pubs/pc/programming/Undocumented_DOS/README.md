### READ.ME (1st Edition)


	                                        27 September 1990
	                                        updated: 15 May 1991
	
	
	READ.ME FOR "UNDOCUMENTED DOS" DISKS
	
	    Here are some scattered last-minute notes regarding the files on
	the two disks that accompany UNDOCUMENTED DOS (edited by Andrew
	Schulman; Addison-Wesley, Reading MA, 1990, $39.95). 
	
	    A number of the programs on this disk have been modified since
	the first printing of UNDOCUMENTED DOS. In particular:
	
	    CHAP2\LDDPMI.C
	    CHAP2\LASTDRV2.ASM
	    CHAP3\DEVCON.C
	    CHAP4\FILES.C
	    CHAP4\PHANTOM.PAS
	    CHAP4\TRUENAME.C
	    CHAP4\MOV.C
	    CHAP5\DOSSWAP.C
	    CHAP5\TEST2E.C
	    CHAP6\ENVEDT.C
	    CHAP6\TSHELL.C
	    CHAP6\INSTCMD.SCR
	
	    In some cases these changes have been reflected in later printings
	of the book.
	
	    If you have any problems with the disks (such as two copies of
	the same disk, disk errors, INTRLIST refusing to load because of
	"illegal use of product," and so on), please call Addison-Wesley
	at (617) 944-3700 x2614.
	
	    Unfortunately, when the introduction to UNDOCUMENTED DOS was
	written, it was too late to thank Michael Spier and Jeff Peoples, of
	Window Book Inc. (Cambridge MA, 617-661-9515), for the fantastic job
	they did in creating INTRLIST.EXE, which is the hypertext database of
	PC interrupts, functions, and data structures, located on the other
	disk. (Based on my experience working with Window Book, I highly
	recommend them to anyone needing online hypertext documentation!)  
	
	    INTRLIST pretty much fills one entire high-density floppy (so
	you'll a hard disk in order to run it).     
	
	
	    This disk contains the source code from the book and the
	resulting compiled executables, plus some additional programs.
	
	    Here are just a few examples of what's in each subdirectory on
	this disk:
	
	\CHAP2
	    LDDPMI (version of LASTDRIVE using the DOS Protected-Mode Interface
	        [DPMI])
	
	\CHAP3
	    DEVLOD.COM (utility for loading device drivers from the DOS
	        command line, including source code in C and assembler)
	    
	\CHAP4
	    FHANDLE.EXE (increase file-handle count, with C source)
	    FREEUP.EXE (release orphaned file handles, with C source)
	    PHANTOM.EXE (sample use of DOS network redirector, including 
	        source in Turbo Pascal)
	
	\CHAP5
	    STSR2E.EXE (pop-up command interpreter, uses the DOS Swappable Data
	        Area, including source in C and assembler)
	
	\CHAP6
	    ENVEDT.EXE (utility for interactively editing the master environment,
	        including source in C and assembler)
	
	\CHAP7
	    MON.COM, ROMMON.COM, SERMON.COM, WINMON.COM (various flavors of DOS
	        debugger, with assembler source)
	
	\CHAP8
	    INTRSPY.EXE, CMDSPY.EXE (the INTRSPY event-driven, script-driven
	        debugger, with sample scripts)
	
	
	    The authors of UNDOCUMENTED DOS would appreciate hearing of any
	problems you have with this software. We would also like to hear any
	comments, criticisms, or suggestions regarding the book itself. Feel
	free to contact us at the electronic addresses printed in the
	introduction to the book.

	    Here are some corrections and commentary to UNDOCUMENTED DOS.
	Thanks to everyone who sent in corrections! (Your help is
	acknowledged in the appropriate place below.)
	
	    NOTE: If you are having problems reading either of the two disks
	that come with UNDOCUDOS, please contact the publisher, Addison-Wesley,
	for replacement disks. Call 617-944-3700, and ask for Debby McKenna.
	
	
	11      As an example of the prevalent attitude towards using undocumented
	        features, it might have been useful to include a quotation, such
	        as "It has been our experience that 'undocumented goodies' are
	        interesting to look at, but dangerous to include in software that
	        is intended for general distribution" (Paul Yao, _Peter Norton's
	        Windows 3.0 Power Programming Techniques_, New York: Bantam Books,
	        December 1990, p. 108; this is quite a good book, by the way).
	        The best counter-example is Windows 3.0 itself, which (as shown
	        on p. 18 of UNDOCUDOS) makes extremely heavy use of 
	        undocumented DOS functions; another example is Microsoft's
	        Windows debugger CVW, which relies heavily on such undocumented
	        Windows functions as WinDebug() and SetEventHook().
	
	16      In the UNDOC.SCR Intrspy script, "DS:SI-byte" and the two
	        occurrences of "DS:DX-byte" should read "DS:SI->byte" and
	        "DS:DX->byte" (arrow -> not hyphen -).
	
	18      The reference to "DOSSPY" should read "INTRSPY."
	
	19      "used in chapter 5 on TSRs": the DOS SDA is also used extensively
	        in chapter 4 on the DOS file system and network redirector.
	
	26      "Get List of List" should of course read "Get List of Lists"
	        (by the way, the actual name for this in the MS-DOS source code
	        is apparently SYSVARS).
	
	28      The section asserting that 25% of DOS is undocumented was not
	        meant to be taken too seriously.
	
	37      The second paragraph should also note that the _asm keyword
	        produces the MSC 6 warning "C4204: in-line assembler precludes
	        global optimizations."
	
	45      Two readers, Martin Heller (BIX: mheller) and Terrence Vaughn
	        (CIS: 72327,2442) found that the assembly-language code at the
	        bottom of the page has an incorrect conditional jump and a
	        missing label. The block at the bottom of the page should read:
	            
	                    jne     dos3up      ; DOS 3+    ; CHANGED
	                    mov     si, 10h     ; DOS 2.x
	                    jmp     short get
	            dos3up: cmp     al, 3                   ; CHANGED
	                    jne     ofs21
	                    and     ah, ah      ; DOS 3.0
	
	        The code continues as is on the top of the next page.
	
	47      "Testing simply for equality (for example version >= 4)" is
	        confused. Should read "==" not ">=" because we're trying
	        to provide an example of what _not_ to do. Testing if
	        (version >= 4) is the correct way to do it; testing if
	        (version == 4) is the wrong way to do it.  (This correction
	        is probably more confusing than our original typographical
	        error!)
	
	65      Four lines from the bottom, "interrupt handle" should read
	        "interrupt handler."
	
	70      "Programs written for Microsoft Windows 3.0 can make
	        undocumented DOS calls without any special handling. This
	        includes Windows 3.0 running in 386 enhanced mode."
	
	        Ahem! Boy, is this statement wrong. I had tested only one
	        undocumented DOS call from a Windows program when I wrote
	        that. It was the LASTDRIVE check from Chapter 2, where 
	        INT 21h AH=52h is called, and then the LASTDRIVE byte is
	        read out of the List of Lists.
	
	        It turns out, this _just happened_ to work, but I should still
	        have known better than to make this stupid claim. Windows
	        3.0 programs in Standard and Enhanced modes are running in
	        protected mode (which is why Windows is finally a usable
	        product). Thus, the same restrictions noted elsewhere in Chapter
	        2 for making undocumented DOS calls from protected mode apply
	        to Windows programs as well. The LASTDRIVE check just happened
	        to work, because INT 21h AH=52h seems to be transparently
	        supported in protected mode (this can't be relied on, however)
	        and because reading the LASTDRIVE byte out of the List of Lists
	        doesn't involve any further pointer dereferencing. For example,
	        trying to walk the DOS device chain or MCB chain would _not_
	        have worked; other undocumented DOS calls (e.g., INT 21h
	        AX=5D06h) are not supported at all in protected mode.
	
	        In order to make undocumented DOS calls from a Windows program
	        running in Standard or Enhanced mode (the only modes that matter),
	        you must use the DOS Protected Mode Interface (DPMI) function
	        to "Simulate Real Mode Interrupt" (INT 31h AX=0300h). In almost
	        all cases, you will then need to map one or more real-mode
	        pointers into your protected-mode address space. This can be 
	        done using either DPMI (the Allocate LDT Descriptors [INT 31h
	        AX=0000h], Get Descriptor [INT 31h AX=000Bh] and Set Descriptor
	        [INT 31h AX=000Ch] calls) or using the Windows AllocSelector()
	        call together with -- ta da! -- some undocumented Windows calls
	        (which will be the subject of a forthcoming book by A. Schulman,
	        D. Maxey, et al., titled _Undocumented Windows Programming_):
	
	        /* a few useful undocumented KERNEL functions */
	        extern DWORD FAR PASCAL GetSelectorBase(unsigned sel);
	        extern DWORD FAR PASCAL GetSelectorLimit(unsigned sel);
	        extern void FAR PASCAL SetSelectorBase(unsigned sel, DWORD base);
	        extern void FAR PASCAL SetSelectorLimit(unsigned sel, DWORD limit);
	
	        In other cases (for example, INT 21h AH=60h), you will need to 
	        allocate a conventional-memory buffer for use by an undocumented
	        DOS call. Use the Windows GlobalDosAlloc() call for that.
	
	        In any case, the statement that Windows programs "can make
	        undocumented DOS calls without any special handling" couldn't
	        be further from the truth. The above notes should get you
	        started. In addition, a forthcoming PC MAGAZINE Lab Notes
	        by A. Schulman (tentatively titled "Moving DOS Programs to
	        Windows with DPMI") will contain further information on this
	        topic, as will a forthcoming book by A. Schulman and D. Maxey, 
	        tentatively titled _The DOS Programmer's Guide to Microsoft
	        Windows_ (Addison-Wesley, due December 1991).
	
	        Those interested in exploring the innards of Windows might
	        want to check out Alan Cobb's pamphlet _Reverse Engineering
	        Windows and OS/2 Software_. Contact Alan at CIS 73170,3543
	        or BIX/MCI (AlanCobb).
	
	73      Discussion of Phar Lap 386|DOS-Extender: "those weird calls (like
	        undocumented DOS) not transparently supported in protected mode."
	        In 386|DOS-Extender 3.0, many undocumented DOS calls _are_
	        supported in protected mode, so this statement is no longer
	        quite accurate. For example, INT 21h AH=52h returns in ES:EBX
	        a pointer to the List of Lists. However, any far pointers
	        in the data structure remain real-mode far pointers, so these
	        would need special handling.
	
	        The LASTDRIVE example is inadequate to bring out the issue
	        of using far pointers in the List of Lists. In Windows 3.0
	        protected mode, LASTDRIVE just happened to work. The same
	        thing would happen in 386|DOS-Extender 3.0. In the second 
	        edition of UNDOCUDOS, we will need an additional example
	        for these environments.
	
	        Also note that Phar Lap now has a second product, 
	        286|DOS-Extender, with a different API from our 386
	        product. In 286|DOS-Extender, you would call DosRealIntr()
	        to issue an INT 21h AH=52h, and then call DosMapRealSeg()
	        to map any real-mode pointers into your program's
	        protected-mode address space. Several programs from
	        UNDOCUDOS were ported to protected mode using 
	        286|DOS-Extender, and appear in its _Developer's Guide_.
	        
	74      the parenthetical remark should read: "(note that INT 2Fh
	        AH=16h and AH=17h are the Microsoft Windows interface
	        for non-Windows applications; for more information, see
	        the INTRLIST.EXE database on disk)."  A detailed discussion
	        of the Windows INT 2Fh functions will appear in the
	        forthcoming book by Schulman and Maxey, noted earlier.
	
	75      The structures at the top of the page are wrong. A better one
	        is:
	
	            /* structure of a protected-mode descriptor */  
	            typedef struct {
	                unsigned limit, addr_lo;
	                unsigned char addr_hi, access, reserved, addr_xhi;
	                } DESCRIPTOR;   
	
	        If you still want the access-rights byte to use an ACCESS
	        bit field, rather than a plain unsigned char, then you must
	        ensure that the bit field occupies only one byte. Microsoft
	        C allows the following non-standard use of unsigned char
	        in a bit field, so:
	
	            typedef struct {
	                unsigned char accessed   : 1;
	                unsigned char read_write : 1;
	                unsigned char conf_exp   : 1;
	                unsigned char code       : 1;
	                unsigned char xsystem    : 1;
	                unsigned char dpl        : 2;
	                unsigned char present    : 1;
	                } ACCESS;
	
	        An improved version of LDDPMI.C appears at the end of these
	        release notes. (The improved version now works with Borland
	        C++ 2.0, as well as with Microsoft C 6.0 and higher.)
	
	76      In dpmi_init(), after the call to _dos_allocmem(), the
	        following line of code should be added:
	
	            dpmi_flags &= ~1;  // this is a 16-bit protected-mode program
	
	        When INT 2Fh AH=1687h returns the DPMI flags in BX, the bottom
	        bit (dpmi_flags & 1) indicates whether the DPMI host supports
	        32-bit programs (Windows 3.0 enhanced mode does). But when
	        passing flags back into the "Real to Protected Mode
	        Switch Entry Point" via (*dpmi)(), the bottom bit of the
	        flags passed in AX indicates whether _this_ is a 32-bit
	        program. LDDPMI is a 16-bit program, so the bit must be turned
	        off.
	
	79      Before the call to dpmi_set_descriptor(), it would have been
	        much simpler to call a dpmi_get_descriptor() function for some
	        known selector (like the program's DS), and then just change
	        the appropriate base-address and limit fields. 
	
	80      "LDDPMI uses functions such as pmode_printf() rather than
	        plain old printf().... Most DPMI servers will in fact 
	        provide protected-mode INT 21h services (the Windows 3.x
	        DOS extender does, for example), but that is a facility
	        provided by the DPMI server, not by DPMI itself."
	
	        This is literally correct, but it still was foolish not to
	        go ahead and use plain old printf(), since any DPMI
	        server will provide the necessary underlying INT 21h services
	        in protected mode. For example, see the program HELLOPMW.C
	        in Ray Duncan, "An Introduction to the DOS Protected Mode
	        Interface," _PC Magazine_, 12 February 1991, p. 370. 
	        (Duncan's three-part series on DPMI in _PC Magazine_,
	        12 February 1991, 26 February 1991, and 12 March 1991, is
	        an excellent introduction to the topic.)
	
	        In fact, this could have been used as an opportunity to
	        explore yet another semi-undocumented aspect of Windows,
	        since the fact that Windows provides INT 21h services
	        in protected mode is kept pretty well hidden (talk about
	        hiding your light under a bushel!). The only documentation
	        is a brief (five-page) document titled "Windows INT 21H and
	        NetBIOS Support for DPMI," which is included in a packet of
	        Microsoft Windows development notes (Part No. 050-030-313). 
	        (Note also that many more DPMI calls are actually supported
	        by Windows than this document indicates.)
	
	88      "INT 4Bh is used for 'DMA Services'": the actual title of
	        the specification is "Virtual DMA Services (VDS), and is
	        available as Microsoft Part No. 098-10869. It is also
	        supported by Windows 3.0 Enhanced mode and 386MAX.
	
	89      change "is still 138,000 bytes" to "are still 138,000 bytes"
	
	90      It is useful to add one line of code to function walk(), so
	        that the ending address of the MCB chain (usually A000h) is
	        displayed. Change the case 'Z' block so that it reads:
	
	            case 'Z' : /* Zbikowski : end of MCB chain */
	                display(mcb);
	                printf("%04X\n", FP_SEG(mcb) + mcb->size + 1);
	                return;
	
	98-9    Ralf Brown (ralf@cs.cmu.edu) points out that INT F0h or so
	        through FFh contain garbage which appears to pointing into
	        one of the currently loaded programs, because the BIOS uses
	        the upper end of the interrupt vector table as a stack
	        during bootup.
	
	100     The assertion that the C free() function, or the Pascal
	        dispose() function, indirectly uses the DOS memory functions
	        isn't quite true. Calls like free() or dispose() don't call
	        INT 21h Function 49h (Release Memory Block); instead, they
	        simply put freed memory blocks back on a free list. To actually
	        release freed memory blocks back to the operating system, you
	        need to use a function like _heapmin() in Microsoft C 6.0 or
	        mark()/release() in Turbo Pascal.
	
	102     "and will stop searching": Ralf Brown states that this is not
	        true. As it turns out, all three allocation strategies search
	        the entire memory chain. Any search sets all three memory-block
	        variables for all three strategies in the DOS SDA (at offsets
	        1Eh, 20h, and 22h; see UNDOCUDOS, pp. 551, 557), and then
	        returns the appropriate one.
	
	111     "COMMAND.COM is always its own parent, and so..." Fine, but
	        we never explain _why_ COMMAND.COM is always its own
	        parent. Here's a good explanation from BIX:
	
	        ibm.dos/secrets.3 #1106, from drifkind, 1510 chars, 
	        Fri Jan 25 20:26:19 1991
	        --------------------------
	        TITLE: Zombie COMMAND.COM rises from dead
	
	        (I'm practicing to write headlines for the National Enquirer.)
	
	        COMMAND.COM contains the default INT 24h handler, the one that
	        prints "Abort, Retry, Ignore" and so on.  What happens when a
	        critical error occurs while executing an internal DOS command?
	        Obviously, the INT 24h handler knows that COMMAND.COM is running
	        and does something other than abort if you press "A", right?
	
	        No, in fact the critical error handler does nothing special.  If
	        you press "A", it returns 2 and DOS terminates the current
	        process.  So why doesn't COMMAND.COM go away?
	
	        When DOS terminates a process, it uses the "parent PID" field in
	        the process's PSP to figure out what process is going to get
	        control when this one terminates.  If the parent PID is the same
	        as the current PID, however, it does not deallocate the program's
	        memory blocks before exiting.  COMMAND.COM sets the parent PID
	        field equal to its own PID, and points the termination address
	        (at offset 0Ah in the PSP) back into itself.  The result is that,
	        on exit, the current program stays active and retains control.
	
	        We all know that if you run COMMAND.COM with the "/p" switch, it
	        does not terminate when you type "exit".  In fact, it DOES exit.
	        The difference is that, with "/p", it does not restore the
	        original parent PID and termination addresses, so DOS more or
	        less ignores the 4Ch service request, just transferring control
	        back into COMMAND.COM.
	
	        And that is why COMMAND.COM's parent PID field points to itself.
	
	122-4   The DEVCON program has been ported to protected mode: see
	        Phar Lap 286|DOS-Extender _Developer's Guide_, pp. 159-165.
	
	125     Change "if you run DEVCON a dash" to "if you run DEVCON with
	        a dash".
	
	125     Change "it's often forgetten" to "it's often forgotten".
	
	137     The block of code in while (CmdPkt.nunits--), before the
	        call to INT 21h AH=53h, should somewhere explain what we're
	        doing:
	
	            _ES = CmdPkt.brkseg;  /* DS:SI -> BIOS Parameter Block */
	            _DS = CmdPkt.inpseg;  /* ES:BP -> Disk Parameter Block */
	
	139     "The function copyptr()... could have been written in C,
	        but doing so would have required the kind of convoluted
	        expressions that have given C the reputation of being a
	        'write-only' language."  Well, I don't know, but the following
	        looks pretty simple to me:
	
	            typedef void far *FP;
	            void copyptr (FP far *src, FP far *dst) { *dst = *src; }
	
	156     "Not long after that (but before the introduction of DOS
	        2.0), an extra sector was added to the format, bringing the
	        storage capacity up to the 360KB we know today."  In fact,
	        Tim Paterson assures us that was done in DOS 2.0.
	
	157     Re: the mentions of S=0, drifkin (BIX) points out that normal
	        PC block devices number physical sectors starting with 1,
	        not 0. Change 'em all to S=1.
	
	158     Change "major reasons many users to upgrade" to "major reasons
	        for...".
	
	158     "Two copies of the FAT are normally maintained by DOS, but
	        no real reason for doing so has been determined." This was
	        a pretty foolish remark, considering that Tim Paterson is 
	        one of the coauthors, and we only needed to ask him why he
	        did this! The answer is that DOS maintains two copies of
	        the FAT is case of _physical_ disk errors; Microsoft used
	        three FATs in standalone BASIC, and this is where the
	        idea of using multiple FATs came from.
	
	158     On the last line, the phrase "together with a flag bit
	        in the format records" is, as Peter Schultz (CIS 70216,074)
	        pointed out, rather vague. Jim Kyle explains that it really
	        isn't a "flag bit," but rather the top four bits in the
	        DPB highest-cluster word (DPB offset 0Dh; see UNDOCUDOS, 
	        p. 507). Checking these bits is preferable to using the boot
	        record.
	
	159     "Any other value indicates..." In fact, drifkind (BIX) 
	        cautions us not to forget about (F)FF7, which marks bad
	        clusters, and (F)FF0 through (F)FF6, which are reserved.
	
	160     "E5h, which is a valid character for use in a filename":
	        it's valid in DOS 3+.
	
	160     "If the first byte of the filename is E5h..." Why E5h?
	        Tim Paterson says because 8" SSSD disks came preformatted
	        with E5h bytes. A disk out of the box thus looked empty,
	        and was essentially ready-to-go, though the FAT still 
	        needed to be cleared (which was done with the built-in
	        CLEAR command in pre-IBM DOS).
	
	161     FAKEFRMT: roedy (BIX) points out that this utility "will
	        inadvertently bring bad tracks back into active duty."
	        Tim Paterson states that FAKEFRMT shouldn't need to
	        rewrite the boot sector. These issues will be taken up
	        in the second edition.
	
	161     "(Byte 2 of the sector for a 12-bit FAT)" should refer
	        instead to Byte 3. (Another catch by Ralf Brown.)
	
	166     LoL+10h: The last sentence on the page asserts that "if
	        larger, this value is replaced by the new maximum value."
	        Ralf Brown, in yet another catch, points out that LoL+10h
	        is actually increased only for the built-in device drivers
	        located in IO.SYS; if the driver's value is greater than
	        LoL+10h for installable drivers, the loader complains that
	        the sector size is too large.
	
	168     "(available directory in 4+" should read "(available directly
	        in 4+".
	
	176     To the phrase "This means that all the named devices seem to
	        exist in all directories of the file system," add the
	        parenthetical remark that they also exist in subdirectory \DEV,
	        even if no such subdirectory exists on disk.
	
	179     "it differed the data thatwas" should read "it differed from
	        the data that was" (two mistakes!; who the #$%*& edited this
	        stuff?!).
	
	182     "Local Description Table" should of course read "Local Descriptor
	        Table".
	
	186     "file stem" should read "file system".
	
	190-1   The TRUENAME program has been ported to protected mode: see
	        Phar Lap 286|DOS-Extender _Developer's Guide_, pp. 86-92.
	
	191     The variable "s" serves no purpose in main(), and in fact
	        could potentially cause a problem (ya see it?). Change main()
	        to the following:
	
	            main(int argc, char *argv[])
	            {
	                char buf[128];
	                if (argc < 2)
	                    ret("usage: dospath <filename>", 1);
	                if (_osmajor < 3)
	                    ret("requires DOS 3.0 or greater", 1);
	
	                if (truename(argv[1], buf))
	                    ret(buf, 0);
	                else
	                    ret("invalid filename", 1);
	            }
	
	193     "The first SFT appears to always hold five possible open-file
	        entries": Ralf Brown explains that this is because the first
	        SFT is compiled right into MSDOS.SYS, for DOS 2.0 through 4.0.
	            
	197     Neil Rubenking (CIS 72241,50) found that struct file didn't
	        work under DOS 3.0. See corrections for p. 527 below for
	        the correct SFT structure for DOS 3.0. 
	
	198     In the function is_psp() the magic number 0x20CD is never
	        explained. This is merely the opcode for the INT 20h
	        instruction, interpreted as an unsigned quantity.
	
	199     The test "FP int2e = (FP) GETVECT(0x2E)" will of course fail
	        if COMMAND.COM, or a program that mimicks COMMAND.COM's use
	        of INT 2Eh, is not present. For example, what happens when
	        the user is running SH.EXE from the MKS Toolkit as their
	        DOS SHELL=?
	
	199     The IS_AUX(), IS_CON(), and IS_PRN() macros are all missing
	        a test for (s[3] == ' '). Otherwise, we would match possible
	        device names such as "AUXIL", "CONTOUR", and "PRNACHO".
	
	210-3   "More File Handles": After UNDOCUDOS was already out, a 
	        useful article on this topic appeared: David Burki, "DOS
	        File Handle Limits," _TECH Specialist_, February 1991,
	        pp. 51-62.
	
	212     Rather than fail if (new_max > files()), it probably would
	        have been a good idea to show how to grow the SFT tables,
	        a la Quarterdeck's FILES.COM program (included with QEMM).
	
	213     FHANDLE.C is an okay program, but it needs to show things
	        more from a C perspective. We at least need to explain why
	        we use _dos_open() and not open() or fopen(). We need to
	        explain why increasing the number of DOS file handles
	        doesn't give your C program more FILE* capacity.
	        This is an incredibly common question. For now, if
	        you do need to increase the number of FILE* in your Microsoft
	        C program, note that _NFILE can be changed in the startup
	        code (see MSC6 STARTUP\CRT0DAT.ASM).
	
	214-5   Roger Jackson (CIS 76535,75) points out that MOV.C doesn't
	        compile with Microsoft C. The problem is that FP_SEG()
	        and FP_OFF() as used here depend on the Turbo C++ style of
	        these macros. As noted in UNDOCUDOS p. 51, Microsoft C's version
	        of these macros requires an lvalue. To fix MOV.C for MSC,
	        change the two blocks of FP_SEG/FP_OFF code:
	
	            void canonicalize(filespec,canonical,errorlevel)
	            // ...
	            void far *lvalue;
	            regs.h.ah = 0x60 ;
	            lvalue = filespec;
	            regs.x.si = FP_OFF(lvalue) ;
	            segregs.ds = FP_SEG(lvalue) ;
	            lvalue = canonical;
	            regs.x.di = FP_OFF(lvalue) ;
	            segregs.es = FP_SEG(lvalue) ;
	            // ...
	
	            void far *lvalue;
	            dpl.ax = 0x5600 ;   /* indirect function is rename */
	            lvalue = &source;
	            dpl.dx = FP_OFF(lvalue) ;
	            dpl.ds = FP_SEG(lvalue) ; /* DS:DX old filespec */
	            lvalue = &target;
	            dpl.di = FP_OFF(lvalue) ;
	            dpl.es = FP_SEG(lvalue) ; /* ES:DI new filespec */
	
	229-30  Subfunctions 0Eh, 0Fh, 11h, 13h, and 17h: for each, add an
	        additonal required input:
	            
	            SDA.CURR_CDS = Current Directory Structure (CDS) for
	                drive with file
	
	        The entries for these subfunctions are already correct in
	        the appendix to UNDOCUDOS, pp. 607-612.
	
	257     The usage message should point out that PHANTOM -u uninstalls
	        the Phantom drive.
	
	276-7   Tim Paterson pointed out that the "; Microsoft C 6.0 only"
	        comment next to MOV SP, BP (which appears once on each page) 
	        is pretty confused. First of all, the MOV SP, BP must of
	        course be balanced with the earlier MOV BP, SP. Second of 
	        all, this optional save/restore of the stack pointer has
	        to do merely with whether the compiler uses the stack or
	        a register for the variable i. This has nothing to do with 
	        MSC 6.0. Thus, the comment should be removed. 
	
	277     "the large amount of space used for our three-line
	        interrupt handler should go unnoticed." This was supposed to
	        say "should _not_ go unnoticed." See S. Freud, _Psychopathology
	        of Everyday Life_, for further details.
	
	280     "When coding in assembly language, you can easily come up
	        with this number..." Perhaps for .COM files, but certainly
	        for .EXE TSRs, E. Nicholas Cupery (CIS 72657,3646) points
	        out that the number is _not_ so easy to come up with!
	        In fact, our statement was a pure "exercise left for the
	        reader" cop-out (that is, we didn't know the answer either,
	        so we just pretended it was a trivial operation).
	
	        Ted Mirecki (CIS 72631,25; author of the wonderful
	        "Tech Notebook" series in the defunct _PC Tech Journal_),
	        responding to comments by Cupery and Mike R. Lovett
	        (CIS 72361,3715), made the following suggestion for deriving
	        the memory footprint of a multi-segment TSR:
	
	        "Instead of calculating the size of each segment & adding
	        the sizes together, calc the parag address of each segment end and
	        select the highest one. Then subtract the parag address of the PSP, 
	        and voila, you have the number of parags taken up by your program.
	
	        "Say the label of the end of a particular segment is ENDLBL.
	        Then to get its parag address, do the following steps:
	        Add 15 to offset of ENDLBL   (rounds up to next parag boundary)
	        Shift it right 4 bits        (gets # of parags in segment)
	        Add to Segment of ENDLBL     (gives parag addr of end of seg).
	
	        "You can either repeat this for all your segs & choose the highest, 
	        or arrange for the segments to be loaded in some particular order
	        & do it only for the topmost one. 
	
	        "Then get the PSP segment and subtract it from the above."
	
	280     Jerry Watkins (CIS 70521,2401) points out the MSC memory map
	        isn't quite right. In DGROUP, the stack appears lower in
	        memory than the near heap. (In your copy of UNDOCUDOS, just
	        swap the two lines "STACK" and "NEAR HEAP".) 
	
	296     "need to examine is that one that" should read "need to examine
	        is the one that".
	
	320     Several readers have noted that the discussion of the INT 2Ah
	        AH=8xh critical-section functions is skimpy. This will be
	        beefed-up either in a future "Release Notes" for the book, 
	        or at least in the second edition. Jack Brennan
	        (John.Brennan@vi.ri.cmu.edu) made the following comments on
	        INT 2Ah Functions 80h/81h:
	
	        "These calls are only made by the DOS kernel if they are enabled
	        by some rather specialized code. All network redirectors that I
	        have seen enable the calls, as does Windows 3.0 in 386 Enhanced
	        mode (but not in Real or Standard mode). Basically, what needs to
	        be done is as follows:
	
	        "1. Find a table of offsets at location 02C3 in the IBMDOS segment.
	        This loc (02C3) is hard-coded into MSREDIR, the Microsoft Net
	        Redirector. The table is zero terminated.
	
	        "2. For each offset in the table, poke the hex value 50 into the byte
	        at IBMDOS:offset. This replaces a RET instruction with a PUSH AX
	        instruction, allowing the applicable subroutines to execute.
	
	        "I am only certain of this with DOS 3.1 to 3.31.
	
	        "I believe that this enabling code would need to be added to the
	        example TSR in Chapter 5 of Undocumented DOS (TSREXAMP.C) in order 
	        to allow the TSR to be robust in a non-networked, non-Windows,
	        non-MSCDEX, etc., environment (assuming compiling with DOS_SWAP
	        enabled)."
	
	322     The test at the bottom of the page, if (dos_level == 4), is
	        confusing, or will be when DOS 5 comes out. Note that at
	        the beginning of the function, we set:
	
	            else if (_osmajor >= 4)
	                dos_level == 4;
	                
	        This is rather confusing. In any case, this code should work
	        with DOS 5.
	
	325     In the paragraph at the bottom of the page, "(unless, of
	        course, a critical section has been flagged via INT 2Fh)"
	        should of course read "via INT 2Ah."
	
	328     The subhead "TSFILE" should read "TSRFILE".
	
	332     "which we can be used" should read "which can be used".
	
	380     In TSHELL.C, it looks as if TSHELL passes an improperly
	        formatted argument list to COMMAND.COM, but Jim Kyle swears
	        up and down that the code works; it's too tricky, but it's
	        not wrong.
	
	393     "find what is called the 'active' environment, _not_ the
	        master environment." Actually, it seems we made things more
	        difficult than necessary. In fact, the "active" environment
	        is most of the time the one you want. For example, ENVEDT,
	        which works off the master environment, doesn't change the
	        correct environment when running under Windows.
	
	398     "For example, if a .BAT file containing a SET statement is
	        compiled with BAT2EXEC, it fails unexpectedly under this
	        situation producing an 'Out of environment space' message."
	        Doug Boling, author of BAT2EXEC (which appeared in _PC Magazine_, 
	        August 1990), thinks we probably had an old copy of BAT2EXEC.
	        The latest versions of _PC Magazine_ utilities can be downloaded
	        from PCMagnet on CompuServe.
	
	405     The discussion of INT 2Eh should note that the real "meat" on
	        this weird aspect of undocumented DOS can be found in Daniel
	        E. Greenberg, "Reentering the DOS Shell," _Programmer's
	        Journal_, May-June 1990, pp. 28-36. This article is the
	        definitive piece on INT 2Eh.
	
	408     In the comments to TEST2E.C, the Microsoft C compilation
	        instructions should refer to SEND2E.C, not "send2e.asm".
	
	409     We need to discuss the issue of running INT 2Eh "clients" like
	        TEST2E.EXE from within a batch file. Michael Mefford ("Running
	        Programs Painlessly," _PC Magazine_, 16 February 1988) claims
	        that programs using INT 2Eh "will not execute batch files nor
	        work from within a batch file." Jeff Prosise, in a good recent
	        article on undocumented DOS ("Undocumented DOS
	        Functions," _PC Magazine_, 12 February 1991) states: "Be careful
	        about how you call interrupt 2Eh. If you aren't, you can crash
	        your system in certain very common situations. The main one if
	        if the program you're using is running under a batch file. 
	        Since INT 2Eh is nonreentrant, DOS uses it to run batch files.
	        So if you run a batch file using INT 2Eh from your program,
	        your system will crash."
	
	        We too have had problems running programs that use INT 2Eh
	        from within a batch file, but nothing so dramatic as crashing
	        the system. Instead, we have found simply that EXIT is not
	        handled properly and that memory can be lost. In any case,
	        the use (or refraining from use!) of INT 2Eh in a batch
	        file needs further discussion in the next edition of UNDOCUDOS.
	
	449     "protected-mode debugging requires an interface more like
	        that of OS/2's DosPTrace()." At the time, this was just a wild
	        guess. It turned out to be true. If you have the Windows SDK,
	        run EXEHDR \WINDOWS\SYSTEM\WINDEBUG.DLL, and you'll find
	        the description "Ptrace for Windows." In fact, the undocumented
	        WinDebug() function is nearly identical to the poorly-
	        documented DosPTrace() function in OS/2. Microsoft claims
	        that WinDebug() will completely go away in Windows 3.1, to be
	        replaced by a openly-documented new interface. In the meantime,
	        and perhaps for some time even after 3.1 is released, WinDebug()
	        is quite important.
	
	453     At the bottom of the page, the phrase "as noted below, INTRSPY
	        also uses -> to indicate fields in a structure" should be
	        deleted; it's not true. INTRSPY uses -> solely to indicate
	        that a register pair should be treated as a pointer to some
	        type. (For example, ds:dx->byte,asciiz,64.)
	
	458     At the bottom of the page, "The following command used to
	        run CMDSPY.EXE" should refer instead to INTRSPY.EXE.
	
	466     "or it parameters replaceable from the DOS command line":
	        delete the word "it."
	
	482     "that function is not available provided by the Compaq ROM
	        BIOS": delete the word "available."
	
	495     Dan Lanciani's name was unfortunately omitted from the list
	        of major contributors of undocumented-DOS material to the
	        Interrupt List maintained by Ralf Brown. Dan contributed
	        INT 21h and INT 2Fh material. Sorry, Dan.
	
	502-4   History buffs may want to replace the vague note "appears to
	        be for CP/M compatibility" for Functions 18h, 1Dh, 1Eh, and 20h
	        with the actual names of the CP/M-80 and CP/M-86 functions for which
	        holes were apparently left:
	            18h:    Get Bit Map of Active Drives
	            1Dh:    Get Bit Map of Read-Only Drives
	            1Eh:    Set File Attributes
	            20h:    Get/Set User (Sublibrary) Number
	        (See David Cortesi, "CP/M-86 vs. MS-DOS: A Technical Comparison,"
	        _Dr. Dobb's Journal_, July 1982, pp. 14-27; in DDJ Vol. 7, 
	        pp. 280-291. The article notes that "MSDOS was commissioned by
	        IBM and produced by the Microsoft Corporation from a base
	        written by Seattle Computer Products, Inc. Lifeboat Associates,
	        an important software vendor, has undertaken to market the
	        system for other 8086-based machines, and to encourage the
	        development of application programs for it." Gee, wonder if 
	        it'll be successful....)
	
	513     21/4B/03:  Bob Moote of Phar Lap Software (rwm@pharlap.com) has
	        reported a bug in INT 21h Function 4Bh Subfunction 03h (Load
	        Overlay). If there is additional data located in the file after
	        the program (i.e., 21/4B/03 does not hit EOF; e.g., a program
	        with a bound-in DOS extender), Load Overlay will load up to 512
	        extra bytes, overflowing your buffer.
	
	514     The note "DOS 2.x destroys all registers" should be amended to
	        note that in DOS 3+, the BX and DX registers are still bashed.
	        (This is noted correctly on p. 429 of UNDOCUDOS.)
	
	527     Neil Rubenking found that the structure provided for the SFT
	        did not work in DOS 3.0. Robin Walker (RDHW@phoenix.cambridge.edu.uk)
	        supplied the correct information.  Thanks, Robin!!  Here 'tis:
	
	Format of DOS 3.0 system file tables and FCB tables:
	 
	Offset  Size    Description
	 00h    DWORD   pointer to next file table
	 04h    WORD    number of files in this table
	 06h    38h bytes per file                   *** NB ***
	 
	        Offset  Size    Description
	 
	        00h-1Eh as for DOS 3.1+
	 
	        1Fh     WORD    byte offset of directory entry within sector ** NB **
	        21h  11 BYTES   filename in FCB format (no path/period, blank-padded)
	        2Ch     DWORD   (if SHARE loaded) ptr to prev SFT sharing same file
	        30h     WORD    (if SHARE loaded) ??? network machine number, I guess
	        32h     WORD    (if SHARE loaded) PSP segment of file's owner
	        34h     WORD    (if SHARE loaded) offs in SHARE code seg of share rec
	        36h     WORD    ??? only seen 0000h         *** NB ***
	 
	The format of sharing records looks the same as already listed.
	
	544-5   Has anyone found what 2F/57/02, 2F/57/03, and 2F/57/04 do?
	        A reader needs this information!  If you know anything, please
	        contact andrew@pharlap.com.
	
	581-2   2A/80, 2A/81: Please see the notes above (p.320).
	
	597     2F/10/00: Note that DOS 4.01 loads share for media >32M, but
	        only for FCB support. The file-sharing code is not turned on
	        until the first call to 2F/10/00. Also note that Microsoft
	        Windows 3.0 enhanced mode provides its own built-in implementation
	        of SHARE.

### Errata (2nd Edition)

	Undocumented DOS, 2nd Edtion		Errata
	by Ralf Brown
	
	
	p. 8, middle
		"easier said than none" should of course read "...than done"
	
	p. 37, last two lines
		"terminate-and-stay (TSR)" is missing "resident" in between
	
	p. 41, end of first paragraph
		unmatched right parenthesis at very end
	
	p. 46, right after first quotation
		"were present at time of OS/2" should read "...at the time..."
	
	p. 52, second paragraph
		"high-colume" should read "high-volume"
	
	p. 56, first word of second paragraph
		"There" should read "These"
	
	p. 62, second paragraph under "DOS Calls from C"
		"have adapted them" should read "have adopted them"
	
	p. 86, last line before Listing 2-16
		"undos_dos_okay" should read "undoc_dos_okay"
	
	p. 102, third paragraph
		"since and entirely separate book" should probably read "entire" for
		"entirely"
	
	p. 117, second paragraph
		"the DPMISH program call C" should read "... can call C"
	
	p. 123, third paragraph
		"that call INT 21h fom" should of course read "... from"
	
	p. 190, second line
		"IBMDOS.COM provide these calls" should read "provides" instead
	
	p. 197, fourth paragraph under "NetWare 4.0 and the Network Redirector"
		missing parenthesis at "for NetWare 4 (though of course"
	
	p. 213, next-to-last paragraph of quotation
		"introduced some hasty bugs" should of course read "nasty" instead
	
	p. 218, fifth line
		"and low and behold" should be "and lo and behold"
	
	p. 280, second paragraph	*******
		IBM's interrupt-sharing spec is in use on millions of machines!  Every
		system running MS-DOS 3.3+ with nonzero STACKS=, in fact.  When MS-DOS
		installs the STACKS= handlers for the hardware interrupts to switch
		stacks, the interrupt handlers use the IBM interrupt-sharing spec.
	
	p. 284, second set of comment lines
		"UBM Link" should naturally by "UMB Link"
	
	p. 285, last set of comment lines
		"but A20 has been off;" should read "but had A20 been off,"
	
	p. 288, Figure 6-5
		comment "switch to DOS's DS; hmm, not truly reentrant after all!"
		is quite simply false.  Pointing at the DOS DS does not in itself
		make a function non-reentrant.  Particularly since at most a single
		memory location gets modified (by subfunctions 01h and 02h).
	
	p. 301, last paragraph before "Tracing a DOS INT 2Fh Call"
		for "call use a new pointer", read "use a near call"
	
	p. 330, third paragraph
		"turns turns"
	
	p. 331, first line after Figure 6-22
		"SFT ndx" should read "SFT index"
	
	p. 335, first paragraph after quotation
		"As far trade secret" should read "As far as trade secret"
	
	p. 346, Table 7-1
		The table is somewhat messed up.  The beginning should read
			Code	Directive	Meaning
			D	DEVICE=		device driver, if present
			E			device driver appendage, if present
			I
			...
	
	p. 362, second paragraph
		for "code and changed", read "code has changed"
	
	p. 364, third paragraph
		The discussion about the two-level upper memory chains is not correct
		for QEMM.  QEMM maintains a UMB chain which is identical to the MS-DOS	
		low memory chain.  It only becomes two-level when MS-DOS allocates the
		upper memory as XMS UMBs and installs its own chain in the allocated
		UMBs.  When using Quarterdeck's own utilities while DOS=NOUMB is in
		effect, the upper memory chain remains single-level (QEMM uses blocks
		marked as belonging to itself to lock out the non-UMB areas between
		UMB regions).
	
	p. 367, first paragraph under "The COM File Format"
		"stack pointer set to 00FE" should actually read "stack pointer set
		to FFFE (or the top of the memory block if it is less than 64K in
		size)"
	
	p. 413, fourth paragraph under "The File Allocation Table"
		Checking only the top four bits to determine whether to use a 12-bit
		or a 16-bit FAT is not completely correct, since the switch-over
		point is actually 0FF6h.
	
	p. 434, third line
		"These 32-byte blocks"--under DOS 4+, they are 33 bytes.
	
	p. 441, first paragraph
		As of version 4.0, SmartDrive no longer uses INT 13h, instead putting
		a 'wrapper' around the block device driver.
	
	p. 466, "FILE* vs. File Handles"
		The first word, "Before" has a wrong font for the first letter.
	
	p. 469, middle
		"FILES=254 is therefore the maximum".  Since SFT index 0 is valid,
		the maximum is in fact FILES=255 even though index FFh is used as
		a free-JFT flag.
	
	p. 485, first paragraph under "More File Handles"
		"the pre-process" should of course read "the per-process"
	
	p. 492, third line
		missing comma in "lock and unlock regions of a file, for checking"
	
	p. 511, two-thirds down
		the comment "only support INT 2Fh AX=1100h through AX=1123h" should
		read "112Eh" instead of 1123h
	
	p. 513, Listing 8-29
		"sft_ptr->dev_info_world" should read "sft_ptr->dev_info_word"
	
	p. 517, third line
		"For all it matter," should read "For all it matters,"
	
	p. 518, last paragraph
		Once again, SmartDrive v4+ does not use INT 13h any more.
	
	p. 528, under "Subfunction 0Ah"
		"DOS 3.0.X" should read "DOS 3.X"
	
	p. 529, "Subfunction 0Fh"
		not properly indented
	
	p. 530, "Subfunction 19h"
		not properly indented
	
	p. 532, fourth line
		missing close quote after
			Another Detection Method
	
	p. 532, "Subfunction 21h"
		note that the conditions under which DOS calls this function are
		precisely those under which another process can change the length
		of the file; for all other sharing modes, the file size will never
		be changed without DOS's knowledge (unless of course there was an
		undetected sharing violation), so there is no need to call the
		redirector to get an updated file size.
	
	p. 538, last paragraph
		Functions 26h through 29h were almost certainly added to support
		NLSFUNC, since both they and NLSFUNC appeared in MS-DOS 3.30.  NLSFUNC
		has no need to write a file, so there is no Write function....
	
	p. 564, third-to-last line
		for "issues the period INT 28h" read "... periodic INT 28h"
	
	p. 587, two-thirds down
		"5D0Bh (for DOS 4 and higher)" is actually "5D0Bh (for DOS 4 only)"
	
	p. 602, Figure 9-23		********
		Unfortunately, the figure, and the following sample assembly language
		routine, are very much wrong on the jump instructions.  Both are
		SHORT jumps, i.e. coded as EBh XXh, rather than FAR jumps.  In
		addition, various software expects the jump at the beginning of the
		header (the interrupt handler's entry point), to jump to the byte
		immediately following the header, i.e. to find the bytes EBh 10h at
		the address pointed at by the interrupt vector.
	
	
	p. 606, Listing 9-26
		"SRDERR" should be "STDERR"
	
	p. 611, under "Keyboard Interrupt"
		extraneous comma in "gives the user better, response time"
	
	p. 618, next-to-last line
		"DesqView" is actually "DESQview"
	
	p. 630, fourth paragraph
		DATE and TIME were external commands in PC-DOS 1.0, and migrated into
		COMMAND.COM with version 1.1.
	
	p. 632, end of "Dealing with BAT Files" section
		missing period
	
	p. 638, end of section preceding "TSHELL, a Simple Command Interpreter"
		missing period
	
	p. 644, end of the second paragraph
		COMMAND.COM puts a portion of its *resident* portion in the HMA when
		DOS is loaded in the HMA.
	
	p. 682, format of PSP
		update:
		3Ch    BYTE    apparently unused by DOS versions <= 6.00
		3Dh    BYTE    (APPEND) TrueName flag (see INT 2F/AX=B711h)
	
	p. 688	INT 21h Function 4302h
		under Returns:, "CX" should be indented a few spaces
	
	p. 745, INT 21h Functions 71h-72h, last paragraph
		MS-DOS has always supported multiple concurrent file finds--simply
		switch the DTA to a different location for each of the concurrent
		finds.
	
	p. 836, Stan Brown, dos.faq
		Missing greater-than sign in "What the heck is 'DGROUP > 64K'?"
	
	p. 844, Arne Shpers
		missing u-umlaut () in "Die endgltige Referenz"
