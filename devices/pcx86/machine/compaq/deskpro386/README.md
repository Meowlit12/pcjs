COMPAQ DeskPro 386 Machines
---------------------------

All our EGA configurations use the `Rev F` [COMPAQ DeskPro 386 ROM](/devices/pcx86/rom/compaq/deskpro386/), dated
September 4, 1986.  It is currently the oldest available DeskPro 386 ROM.  The VGA did not exist until 1987, so it
makes sense to use the EGA with a contemporary ROM.

All our VGA configurations use the `Rev J.4` [COMPAQ DeskPro 386 ROM](/devices/pcx86/rom/compaq/deskpro386/), dated
January 28, 1988.

All these machine configurations also include an unformatted "Type 5" [47Mb Hard Disk](/disks/pcx86/fixed/47mb/).  To
create a single 47Mb partition, you must use [COMPAQ MS-DOS 3.31](/disks/pcx86/dos/compaq/3.31/) or newer; older versions
of DOS could create partitions only up to 32Mb, and all partitions had to reside within the first 32Mb of disk space.
